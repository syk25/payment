# Discount Policy

## Description
I've introduced discount interface in order to implement policies according to their own features.
Currently, the specific policies are,
- discount by stores
- discount by payment methods

## Process
1. declare interface
    - declare method
2. declare classes by policy
   - implement interface
   - implement methods
3. implement test cases
